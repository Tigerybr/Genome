# Genome Assembly (Collaborating with Ce Qiu)
In this project, we designed and programmed a computing algorithm to sequence the target genome and produce an assembly via contigs and scaffolds based on paired-read data of DNA sequence. We also illustrated the algorithm and next steps for further improvement in a video presentation.
